            <p>The new year tree is made, it is a unique thing for children and adults, which is the object that can be seen in every house during the holiday. The whole family takes participation in decorating a tree, with toys, candles, and different New Year Lights. Children consider a tree to be mysteries because the Russian Santa Clause hides the presents under this tree.

                I love this eve. Many days before there is a preparation of cakes for the new year, at the parties, there is a new year cake cutting ceremony at midnight â€” this way people enjoy the parties and celebrate the new year festival.</p>
